# Next.js Mini Project

## Overview
This is my first project using Next.js, created to understand its core functionalities like routing and automatic handling of pages. The focus of this project is to explore the framework rather than design or feature complexity.

## Features
- **Automatic Routing**: Utilized Next.js file-based routing system.
- **API Routes**: Explored basic API routes in Next.js.
- **Static and Server-Side Rendering**: Tested different rendering strategies.
- **Basic Page Navigation**: Implemented simple navigation between pages.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Package manager (npm or yarn)

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
